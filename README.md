# Call You Maybe

"Call You Maybe" is game made at the 2018 Global Game Jam by team Fa√≠sca.

An old lady has an important message to send. In order to do that that, she sells her soul to the devil in exchange for a cursed phone that gives her powers. Now, if she keeps a conversation with anyone long enough, she will transfer her conciousness to whomever she is talking to.
